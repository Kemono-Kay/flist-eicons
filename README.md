# flist-eicons

This plugin allows you to use ecions from F-list as emotes.

In order to use an eicon, type it like `:f!eicon:` but replace 'eicon' with the name of the icon you are using.

The file `flisteicons.plugin.js` is the actual plugin. Place this file in your BetterDiscord plugins folder, which should load it automatically. If not, you'll find it in your plugin list in Discord's settings where you can activate it manually.

Be aware that F-list eicons may be explicit in nature; this plugin does not control the content of the eicons themselves, it only fetches them from the F-list website.
